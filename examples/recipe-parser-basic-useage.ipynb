    "# Basic Useage of a Recipe Parser\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of a recipe parser, in this case the NYTimes Cooking parser. The parser is used to translate the HTML content of the page into things python can understand. Each parser object has the following variables available to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "recipe_name      # the name of the recipe\n",
    "recipe_author    # the author of the recipe\n",
    "time_yield       # the time it takes to cook and the yield\n",
    "description      # description or introduction of the recipe\n",
    "ingredients_full # the full ingredient list, including quantities (eg `3 Tablespoons sugar`)\n",
    "ingredients_name # just the name of the ingredients (eg `sugar`)\n",
    "directions       # directions for preparation\n",
    "notes            # any notes or tips to accompany the recipe\n",
    "categories       # categories or tags associated with the recipe\n",
    "servings         # number of servings\n",
    "nutrition        # nutrition information, if available\n",
    "img_url          # url of any images for the recipe\n",
    "```\n",
    "Calling `print()` on the recipe (demonstrated below) produces a nice text representation of the recipe"
