# Galvanize Capstone Project
## Jayson Stemmler

Welcome to the repository for my capstone project.
This is mostly a placeholder README until I get working
a bit more.

The structure of the repository is as follows:

### ./examples
Contains some Jupyter (iPython) notebooks that demonstrate
some of the functionality of the individual code pieces

### ./gtools
Main code tools are contained in here. There are parsers and
some other utilities for doing the actual work

### ./data
Contains data or scripts to make data

### ./data-acquisition
