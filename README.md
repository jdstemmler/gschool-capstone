# Recipe Search and Recommendation
## Jayson Stemmler

This project is an advanced recipe search and recommendation tool developed
as a capstone project for the Galvanize Immersive Data Science program.
The main goals of the project are as follows:

* Provide recipe recommendations based off of user input of ingredients
that they want to use and ingredients that they don't want to use. 

* Allow the user to like or dislike a particular recipe to see more
or less of those types of recipes
